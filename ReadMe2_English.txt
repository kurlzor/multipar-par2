
Restore damaged or lost files with PAR 2.0 recovery files.

Parchive 2.0 client by Yutaka Sawada

/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */

[ Note ]

 This client support "Comments" in PAR files.
 This supports Multi-Byte Character like Japanese.
 This supports empty file (0 length file).
 This supports sub-directory and empty folder (directory tree).

 This verifies source files more speedy or closely by option.
 This re-calculate inverting matrix when it was failded at certain parity block.
 This search same source block as lost block in all Recovery-Set files and copy.
 This does not use parity block when block size is 4-byte.
 This trys to search available source blocks by their original order.
 Thus this may recover with less parity block than other PAR 2.0 clients.

 You may set many source files by file-list instead of command line.
 Source files may locate different directory with Recovery files.

 Max block size is 1GB.
 You cannot specify Non-Recovery-Set files. (Empty files are set.)
 Number of source blocks is limited up to 32768. (Files are limited up to 65536.)
 Number of creating recovery blocks is limited up to 65535.

 This client consumes memory very much.
 Verifying file use same memory as the file or double of block size.
 Recoverying block use more memory as the number of block is many.

 This requires a PC of Windows XP or later (Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc).
 This is developed with Visual C++ 2008 on Windows 7.
